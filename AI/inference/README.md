This model is designed to recognize, track, and classify near-shore ocean waves in video footage using Python and OpenCV. Hereâ€™s a concise summary of how it works:

### High-Level Workflow

1. **Preprocessing**
   - Video frames are downsized to speed up processing.
   - Background modeling is performed using a Gaussian Mixture Model (MOG) to separate moving waves (foreground) from the static background.
   - Denoising and morphological operations clean up the foreground extraction.

2. **Detection**
   - The preprocessed frames are analyzed to find contours (shapes) that may represent waves.
   - These contours are filtered based on their size and shape to identify potential wave objects.

3. **Tracking**
   - Identified wave objects are tracked across frames to maintain their identity and follow their movement.
   - Tracking is simplified by domain assumptions (waves mainly move in one direction), allowing for efficient, identity-preserving localization.
   - Multiple contours belonging to the same wave can be merged.

4. **Recognition**
   - Wave candidates are classified as true waves by analyzing their dynamics: mass (size) and displacement (movement).
   - Only objects with the expected movement and size over time are recognized as actual waves.

### Output

- The model produces a log file with tracking details and a visualization video highlighting detected and tracked waves.
- It provides statistics such as the number of recognized waves, their lifespan, displacement, and mass.

### Assumptions

- The camera is static and elevated, providing a clear, unobstructed view of the waves.
- The method is robust in scenes with minimal occlusion and clear distinction between waves and background.

**In summary:**  
The model uses a pipeline of background subtraction, contour detection, object tracking, and dynamic analysis to reliably identify and classify near-shore ocean waves in video footage.
